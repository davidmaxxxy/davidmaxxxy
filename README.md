# 👋 Hi, I'm David Maksymiuk

🚀 **Technical Product Manager | Full-Stack Developer | Innovator**

## 🙋‍♂️ Bio

**Product Manager turned Software Engineer passionate about solving real-world problems through data-driven strategies and AI-powered solutions.**

Born and raised between 🇩🇪 Germany & 🇵🇱 Poland, I gained a unique perspective on both developed and developing economies. This experience ignited my passion for economics, business, and innovation as drivers of growth and prosperity. Constantly exchanging currencies 💶<>💷 also sparked my deep interest in finance, eventually leading me into the world of cryptocurrencies and fintech.

My hunger to make the most of global opportunities brought me to the 🇬🇧 UK, where I pursued my studies. After graduating from the London School of Economics with a degree in **Management, Digital Business & Information Systems**, I ventured into digital transformation, co-founded a fintech startup for the restaurant industry (👨‍💻 my first hands-on experience with frontend development) before advancing into the crypto space at **Bubbl Digital** and **Blockchain.com**. Now, I serve as a **Digital Product Manager/Product Lead** at **Cynergy Bank**, a fast-growing digital bank for UK SMEs.

To deepen my technical expertise, I completed a **Software Engineering Bootcamp** at **BrainStation**, sharpening my frontend skills (*HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js*) and expanding into backend development (*Node.js, Knex.js, MySQL*).

I am actively exploring opportunities as a **Software Engineer**, eager to join a dynamic company tackling big problems with innovative solutions, collaborating with a team of industry experts to make a meaningful impact.
